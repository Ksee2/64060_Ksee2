## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

p <- read.csv("pharmaceuticals.csv",header = TRUE)
head(p)
>> A) a. Use only the numerical variables (1 to 9) to cluster the 21 firms. Justify the various choices made in 
conducting the cluster analysis, such as weights for different variables, the specific clustering algorithm(s) 
used, the number of clusters formed, and so on. 

p1 <- p[,3:11]
head(p1)

>>Scaling all of the quantitative variables in the data

ps <- scale(p1)
head(ps)

>> Determine number of clusters to do the cluster analysis

wss <- (nrow(ps)-1)*sum(apply(ps,2,var))
wss

for (i in 2:15) wss[i] <- sum(kmeans(ps,centers=i)$withinss)
wss

>> K-Means Cluster Analysis - Fitting the data with 5 clusters

fit <- kmeans(ps, 5)
>> Below command gives the mean value of all quantitative variables for each cluster.

aggregate(ps,by=list(fit$cluster),FUN=mean)
ps1 <- data.frame(ps, fit$cluster)
ps1
library(cluster)
clusplot(ps, fit$cluster, color=TRUE, shade=TRUE, labels=2, lines=0)

>> B) Interpret the clusters with respect to the numerical variables used in forming the clusters. 

>> Cluster 1 - Row 1,3,4,5,19,20
Cluster 2 - Row 2,6,18
Cluster 3 - Row 11,13,15,17
Cluster 4 - Row 7,10,16,21
Cluster 5 - Row 8,9,12,14
By the output of > aggregate(ps,by=list(fit$cluster),FUN=mean), we see that
Cluster 1 has lowest Leverage.
Cluster 2 has highest PE ratio, lowest ROE, lowest ROA, lowest Asset Turnover, lowest Net Profit Margin
Cluster 3 has highest Market Cap, highest ROE, highest ROA, highest Asset Turnover
Cluster 4 has highest Net Profit Margin, lowest Beta, lowest PE Ratio, lowest Rev growth.
Cluster 5 has highest Beta, highest Leverage, highest Rev growth and lowest Market Cap.

>> C) Is there a pattern in the clusters with respect to the numerical variables (10 to 12)? (those not used in 
forming the clusters) 

>> There exists a pattern in the clusters in the Media recommendation variable. Cluster 3 has the highest Market Cap, the highest ROE, the highest ROA, the highest Asset Turnover do not have any Sell Media recommendation. Cluster 3 has a "mostly buy" recommendation with one strng buy recommendation. Cluster 2 with highest PE ratio, lowest ROE, lowest ROA, lowest Asset Turnover, lowest Net Profit Margin have mostly Hold recommendation. Cluster 4 with highest Net Profit Margin, lowest Beta, lowest PE Ratio, lowest Rev growth have mostly Hold recommendation.

>> D) Provide an appropriate name for each cluster using any or all of the variables in the dataset. 
>> We would in this case be naming each of the clusters based upon the quantitative variables. This is reflected below: 
Cluster 1 - Lowest Leverage cluster
Cluster 2 - High PE ratio, Low ROE, ROA, Asset Turnover, Net Profit Margin Cluster
Cluster 3 - High Market Cap, ROE, ROA, Asset Turnover cluster
Cluster 4 - High Net Profit Margin, Low Beta, PE Ratio, Rev growth cluster
Cluster 5 - High Beta, Leverage, Rev growth and Low Market Cap cluster
